# ims-v1.0
Inventory Management System for shops

1. Project Setup
Initialize the MERN Stack:

Backend: Use Node.js with Express.js.
Frontend: Use React.js with Material-UI for a modern UI.
Database: Use MongoDB for storing user data, inventory data, and theme preferences.
Package Installation:

Backend: express, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, cookie-parser, express-session, dotenv, cors, async-handler, express-validator.
Frontend: react, react-dom, axios, react-router-dom, @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, redux, redux-thunk, @reduxjs/toolkit.
2. Folder Structure (MVC Design Pattern)
Backend:

models/ - Define MongoDB schemas (User, Inventory, Theme, etc.).
controllers/ - Implement business logic and handle requests.
routes/ - Define routes for the application (Auth routes, Inventory routes, etc.).
middleware/ - Include authMiddleware, errorHandler, and asyncHandler.
utils/ - Utility functions (token generation, cookie handling, etc.).
config/ - Configuration files (database connection, environment variables).
Frontend:

components/ - Reusable React components.
pages/ - Different pages (Login, Dashboard, Inventory, etc.).
redux/ - State management with Redux.
services/ - API service functions using Axios.
themes/ - Light and Dark theme configurations.
hooks/ - Custom React hooks for theme, auth, etc.
3. Authentication and Authorization
User Registration and Login:
Use bcrypt to hash passwords.
Use jsonwebtoken to generate JWT tokens for session management.
Implement refresh tokens for better security.
Authorization:
Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure different users (admin, manager, staff) have appropriate access.
Middleware to check if the user is authenticated and has the correct role.
4. Session and Cookies Management
Session Management:
Use express-session to manage sessions.
Store session data in MongoDB for persistence.
Cookies:
Use cookie-parser to manage cookies.
Store JWT in HTTP-only cookies to secure against XSS attacks.
5. Theme Management
Dark/Light Theme Implementation:
Use Material-UIâ€™s theming capabilities to switch between dark and light themes.
Store the selected theme in both local storage (for immediate use) and the database (for persistent user preferences).
Theme Selection API:
Create API routes to save and fetch the user's theme preference from the database.
6. Inventory Management Features
CRUD Operations:
Implement create, read, update, and delete operations for inventory items.
Include features for filtering, sorting, and searching inventory items.
7. Error Handling
Global Error Handler:
Use express-error-handler to manage errors centrally.
AsyncHandler:
Use async-handler to handle asynchronous operations and avoid unhandled promise rejections.
8. API Routes Handling
RESTful API Design:
Follow RESTful principles for designing the API routes.
Include versioning (/api/v1/) for future upgrades.
Route Protection:
Protect routes using authentication and role-based access middleware.
9. Filters and Search
Filters:
Implement filtering options on inventory data (e.g., by category, price range).
Search:
Implement a search feature for inventory items using text-based search or indexed fields.
10. Deployment
Backend: Deploy on a platform like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
Frontend: Deploy on Netlify or Vercel.
Database: Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-hosted database.
11. Testing
Unit Tests: Write tests for individual components using Jest or Mocha/Chai.
Integration Tests: Ensure components work together correctly.
End-to-End Tests: Use Cypress for full application testing.
